            >"Muhammad Yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to
            translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions
            of people, not only in Bangladesh, but also in many other countries.
            Loans to poor people without any financial security had appeared to
            be an impossible idea. From modest beginnings three decades ago,
            Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed
            micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle
            against poverty."</em
